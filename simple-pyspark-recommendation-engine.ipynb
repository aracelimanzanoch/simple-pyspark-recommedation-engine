    "Apache Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters (on top of Hadoop) with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. It is up to 100 times than Map Reduce system and it allows performing in-memory cluster computing what is especially well suited for predictive analytics.\n",

    "- Spark SQL\n",

    "Actually Spark provides high-level APIs for Scala (Spark's native language), Java, R and Python languages, being this last one, PySpark, the one used for this implementation through Jupyter Notebook (Python 2.7 Kernel).\n",

    "Spark MLlib is Spark's machine learning library and it allows us to build scalable predictive/exploratory analytics system easily. For the specific case of a recommendation engine implementation based on a [userID, itemID, rating] datatset, as a rating regression problem, it provides the Collaborative Filtering technique through ALS algorithm, which will be used in this case. More information about this algorithm implementation in the actual Dataframe-based Spark's MLlib Dataframe-based API can be found here: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-collaborative-filtering.html.\n",

    "### Collaborative filtering techniques for recommendation systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering techniques explore the idea that relationships exists between products and people's interests. Many recommendation systems, also called recommender systems, use Collaborative Filtering to realize these relationships and to give an accurate recommendation of a product that the user may like or enjoy. Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). These predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users, who have similar ratings with the active user. Predictions obtained by a collaborative filtering technique are specific to the user, but use information gleaned from many users. This differs from the naive approach of giving an average (non-specific) score for each item of interest, for example based on its number of votes (most popular items).\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are some Challenges with Collaborative Filtering:\n",
    "- Data sparsity: having a Large Dataset will most likely result in a user-item matrix being large and sparse, which may provide a good level of accuracy but also pose a risk to speed. On the other hand, having a small dataset would result in faster speeds but lower accuracy.\n",
    "- 'Cold start': this is where new users do not have a sufficient amount of ratings to give an accurate recommendation.\n",
    "- Scalability: as the number of users increases and the amount of data expands, Collaborative Filtering algorithms will begin to suffer drops in performance, simply due to the sheer increase in volume.\n",
    "- 'Synonyms': refers to the frequency of items that are similar, but are labeled differently and, for instance, treated differently by the recommendation system, even though, functionally, they're very similar to one another.\n",
    "- 'Gray Sheep': refers to the users that have opinions that don't necessarily 'fit' or are alike to any specific grouping. These users do not consistently agree or disagree on products or items, therefore making recommendations a non-beneficiary to them.\n",
    "- Shilling Attacks: are the abuse of this system by rating certain products high and other products low regardless of personal opinion. Therefore allowing that product to be recommended more often.\n",
    "- 'Long Tail' effect: In some recommendation systems, there is a lack of diversity for recommendations. This is because popular items get recommended more often simply because of the fact that more users use and rate them. These ratings represent information that is used by the system, which in turn, creates further recommendations to other users. Now there are more users that'll use, watch, and purchase that product making it even more popular. This creates a cycle where new items are just a shadow behind the popular items resulting in a lack of diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these and other considerations building a recommendation system can be quite difficult sometimes. Here there's just a simple recommendation system built using Apache Spark MLlib (Dataframe-based) ALS algorithm implementation, as a rating regression system, to get some practical insights rather than a technical construction.\n",

This dataset has been chosen to explore a different use case for a recommendation system and also (and maybe more important) to keep simplicity (because no additional metadata is taken into account in the feature set) and a big enough number of samples (to observe the advantage of speed provided by Spark).\n",

    "Model selection process will be performed through cross-validation analysis with automatic hyperparameter tunning. This tunning is done by defining a grid of model's hyperparameters combinations and running a grid search over the combinations to compare the performance of the resulting models and finally get the optimal one. The ALS hyperparameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- rank = the number of latent factors in the model (4, 8 and 12 as selected values)\n",
    "- maxIter = the maximum number of iterations (default value)\n",
    "- regParam = the regularization parameter (0.1, 0.05 and 0.01 as selected values)\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous process can be rapidly implemented using Spark CrossValidator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to measure how good each model hyperparamenter selection is so we can compare it against other tries to finally keep the best ALS model, we have to set a evaluator based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as it is commonly used as main evaluation metric in regression analysis. RMSE compares the predicted values from the training set with the real values present in the validation set. By adding the absolute error od the differences and taking the average of those values we get a measure of the model's error. The  smaller  the  error, the better the forecasting ability of that model according to the RMSE criterion.\n",
